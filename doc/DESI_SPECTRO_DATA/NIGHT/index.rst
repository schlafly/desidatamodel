NIGHT

``NIGHT`` is the night of observation in YYYYMMDD format.  The "night" roles
over at noon local time, so all data taken between sunset and sunrise belong to the same night (i.e. the date of the sunset).

Raw data files for individual exposures are grouped in EXPID subdirectories
within each NIGHT.
